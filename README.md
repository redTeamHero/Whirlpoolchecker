This Python script is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and validate proxies efficiently. It checks the validity of different types of proxies, including HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5, by attempting to connect to a specified website (default: https://google.com/). The script can handle multiple proxies at once using threading, which speeds up the validation process.

Key Features:

    Proxy Validation: The script verifies proxies by sending requests and measuring response times. Proxies that fail to respond within a specified timeout are deemed invalid.
    Proxy Management: Valid proxies can be written back to a file for future use, replacing the old list with only verified proxies.
    Integration with Proxychains: For users leveraging proxychains for routing network traffic, this script can automatically add valid proxies to the proxychains.conf file.
    User Agent Rotation: To mimic realistic browsing behavior, the script uses a variety of user agents randomly chosen from a predefined list or an external file.
    Cyclic Execution: Users can set the script to run at regular intervals, continuously validating and updating the proxy list. This is ideal for maintaining an up-to-date list of working proxies.

Customizable Options:

    Users can specify the proxy type (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5), timeout period, site for validation checks, and paths to proxy list and proxychains.conf files via command-line arguments.
    Verbose mode is available for detailed output, making debugging and monitoring more accessible.
    Random user agents can be selected per proxy check to avoid detection and mimic genuine traffic.

This script is a powerful solution for anyone needing to maintain a reliable set of proxies, whether for security testing, anonymous browsing, or network research purposes.


Here are some example commands that demonstrate how to use the script with different options:

1. **Basic Proxy Check:**
   - Validate proxies from the default list (`output.txt`) using HTTP method and a 20-second timeout.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py
   ```

2. **Check Proxies with Custom Timeout and Verbose Output:**
   - Use a 10-second timeout for each proxy check, enable verbose output for detailed feedback.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --timeout 10 --verbose
   ```

3. **Validate Proxies from a Custom List File:**
   - Check proxies listed in `my_proxies.txt` using HTTPS method.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --list my_proxies.txt --proxy https
   ```

4. **Use Random User Agent for Each Proxy Check:**
   - Randomly select a user agent for each proxy from the list of user agents.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --random_agent
   ```

5. **Check Proxies and Add Valid Ones to Proxychains Configuration:**
   - Validate proxies and add valid ones to the specified `proxychains.conf` file.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --add_to_proxychains --proxychains_conf /path/to/custom_proxychains.conf
   ```

6. **Set Up Cyclic Execution to Run Every 60 Seconds:**
   - Run the proxy check and update cycle every 60 seconds.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --cycle 60
   ```

7. **Validate SOCKS5 Proxies and Specify a Different Website for Validation:**
   - Use SOCKS5 proxies and check their validity using `https://example.com`.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --proxy socks5 --site https://example.com
   ```

8. **Combine Options for a Comprehensive Check:**
   - Use a 15-second timeout, select random user agents, enable verbose output, and cycle every 120 seconds.
   ```bash
   python3 script_name.py --timeout 15 --random_agent --verbose --cycle 120
   ```
